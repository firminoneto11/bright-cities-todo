    First, we create an object called 'form' using the class TaskForm with the data inputted by the user that is inside
    the request.POST attribute.

    Then we validate the form with the is_valid() method, which is provided by the ModelForm class, and if it is valid
    we save it into the database and redirect the user to the home page.

    Now if the request method isn't POST, we simply return the rendered page and also if the form isn't valid, we render
    the page again.
