<!--Screens-->
<div align='center'><h2>👻 App screens 👻</h2></div>
<p>The web application is divided by the operations that exists within the code:</p>

- Creating a task
- Listing the task(s)
- Updating and deleting the tasks

<p>First, if there aren't any tasks registered in the database, the following screen will be displayed:</p>

<h2>Creating a task</h2>
<p>When the 'New task' button is pressed, the user will be able to create a new task. There are a few things to notice:</p>

- The task name can have a length up to 25 characters;
- The task name is not optional;
- The task's description is optional

<p>Bellow we can see the process of creating a task.</p>

<h2>Listing the tasks</h2>
<p>After a successful task registration, the user will be redirected to the home page, which will now show the tasks that are stored in the database. By default, every new task is checked as 'To Do'. Check out bellow how the tasks are displayed.</p>

<img src="./readme_content/gif_3.gif" alt="A gif showing the tasks being listed.">

<h2>Updating the tasks</h2>
<p>Now that we have some tasks stored, if the user clicks on any of the tasks that are listed, the application will redirect the user to the page where he/she can both update and delete the task that was selected.<br>
Bellow we can see the update process.
</p>

<h2>Deleting the tasks</h2>
<p>And finally, we can do the same process, select a task of the list and choose the 'delete' option. This will delete the selected task from the database.<br>
Check the delete process bellow.
</p>

<img src="./readme_content/gif_5.gif" alt="A gif showing the delete process">

<p>Also, after every successful update and delete, the user will be redirected to the home page, which is dynamic, meaning that if there are any task in the database, it will show them, otherwise, it will show a nice message instead.</p>
